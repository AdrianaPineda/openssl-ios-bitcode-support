Spec repo for openssl with bitcode support

# Versioning
Versioning is the same as: https://github.com/FredericJacobs/OpenSSL-Pod

```
Because OpenSSL's version numbers are not compatible with the CocoaPods version numbering, we will agree on the following.

OpenSSL version: A.B.CD will become A.B.C*100 + place of D in the alphabeth.

Example: OpenSSL 1.0.1h => OpenSSL 1.0.108
```
